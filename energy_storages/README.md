# Energy Storages

Energy storage systems are devices or technologies that store excess energy for later use. They are used in a wide range of applications, including renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, and backup power systems. Energy storage systems allow excess energy to be stored and used when needed, rather than being wasted. This can help to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and improve energy efficiency. There are several different types of energy storage systems available, including batteries, hydrogen, flywheels, pumped hydro storage, and compressed air energy storage. Some of the key factors to consider when choosing an energy storage system include capacity, efficiency, lifespan, and cost. Energy storage systems are an important component of a sustainable energy system and are essential for increasing the reliability and stability of the grid.
