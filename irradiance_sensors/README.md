# Irradiance Sensors

Irradiance sensors are devices that are used to measure the intensity of solar radiation, or the amount of solar energy that is received at the surface of the Earth. They are used in a wide range of applications, including solar energy systems, weather forecasting, and environmental monitoring. Irradiance sensors are available in a variety of sizes and configurations to meet the specific measurement needs of different applications. Some of the key factors to consider when choosing an irradiance sensor include accuracy, sensitivity, response time, and operating temperature range. Irradiance sensors are an essential component of many solar energy systems and are used to optimize the performance and efficiency of these systems by accurately measuring the amount of solar energy that is available.
