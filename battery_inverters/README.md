# Battery Inverters

A battery inverter is a device that converts direct current (DC) electricity from a battery into alternating current (AC) electricity, which can be used to power household appliances and electronics. These inverters are essential for backup power systems, off-grid solar energy systems, and grid-tie solar energy systems.
