# Battery Inverters

A battery inverter is a device that converts direct current (DC) electricity from a battery into alternating current (AC) electricity, which can be used to power household appliances and electronics. These inverters are essential for backup power systems, off-grid solar energy systems, and grid-tie solar energy systems. They are available in a variety of sizes and configurations to meet the specific needs of residential, commercial, and industrial applications. Some of the key features to consider when choosing a battery inverter include power capacity, efficiency, waveform type, and compatibility with different battery types.
