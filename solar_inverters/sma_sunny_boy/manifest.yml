      The grid voltage or grid impedance at the connection point of the inverter is too high. The inverter has disconnected from the utility grid.
      Corrective measures:
      - Ensure that the correct country data set has been configured ( > Configuring the Country Data Set).
      - Check whether the grid voltage at the connection point of the inverter is permanently in the permissible range.
      - If the grid voltage is outside the permissible range due to local grid conditions, contact the grid operator. The grid operator must agree with an adjustment of the voltage at the feed-in point or with a change of the monitored operating limits.
      - If the grid voltage is permanently within the permissible range and this message is still displayed, contact the Service ( > Contact).
