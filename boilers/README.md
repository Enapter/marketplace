# Boilers

Boilers are heating systems that use a heated fluid, such as water or steam, to provide warmth to a building or facility. They are used in a wide range of residential, commercial, and industrial applications, and are available in a variety of sizes and configurations to meet the specific needs of different properties. Boilers can be powered by a variety of fuels, including natural gas, propane, oil, wood, and electricity. Some of the key features to consider when choosing a boiler include fuel type, efficiency rating, heat output, and size. Boilers are an efficient and cost-effective way to heat homes and buildings, and are easy to install and maintain. They are also an environmentally friendly choice as many modern boilers are designed to be energy efficient and have low emissions.
