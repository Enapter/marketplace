## Requirements

1. **EMS-ESP / EMS bus Wi-Fi Gateway setup**

    You require setup **EMS-ESP** according to the [manual](https://bbqkees-electronics.nl/wiki/index.html).
    The EMS bus Wi-Fi Gateway must be connected to the same IP network where your Enapter Gateway is connected.

3. **Latest version of Enapter Gateway Software**

    Enapter Gateway Software must support Virtual UCM. Download latest version at [https://fw.enapter.com](https://fw.enapter.com).

## Running EMS-ESP

1. Save important parameters needed for further setup:

- EMS Bus Gateway **IP address**. You can find this at EMS-ESP Web interface **Network Connection** -> **Network Status**.
