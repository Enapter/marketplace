# Solar Collector Systems

Solar Ð¡ollector (Thermal) Systems are specialized installations that capture and convert sunlight into thermal energy for a wide range of heating applications. These systems work by absorbing solar radiation through collector panels and transferring that heat to a fluid (usually water or air) which is then circulated to provide hot water for homes, businesses, and industrial facilities, space heating for buildings, pool and spa heating, agricultural processes, and various manufacturing operations requiring process heat.
