# Battery Management Systems and Batteries

A battery management system (BMS) is a system that monitors and manages the performance of a battery or group of batteries in a battery pack. The BMS helps to optimize the performance of the battery and extend its lifespan by monitoring and regulating factors such as temperature, voltage, current, and state of charge. It also provides protection against overcharge, overdischarge, and short circuit. Battery management systems are used in a wide range of applications, including electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and portable devices. They are essential for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of batteries, and are available in a variety of configurations to meet the specific needs of different applications.
